// `QBAIAnswerAssistant` helps generate an answer in a chat based on the history of correspondence. Generation is carried out using the OpenAI model. There are two ways to generate responses: one is direct OpenAI API requests using a key, and the second is proxy requests using a QuickBlox user token. The second method organizes a more secure communication channel by saving the keys from OpenAI on the server and checking through the QuickBlox instance that the request is made by the user and not by an attacker.

/// Using `Settings.serverPath` a proxy server  like the [QuickBlox AI Assistant Proxy Server](https:github.com/QuickBlox/qb-ai-assistant-proxy-server) offers significant benefits in terms of security and functionality:
///
/// - Parameters:
///  - history: An array of `Message` objects representing the chat history.
///  - settings: The settings conforming to the `Settings` protocol, including tone, API key, user token, and server path.
///
/// - Returns: The generated answer as a String.
